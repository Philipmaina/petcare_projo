div#add_pet{

}


// this is the button when clicked that i want the form to slide dowm
// also i am adding the visiblle property that specifies whether or not an element is visible because it is obvious that by default it is visible but i want to be able to toggle this class - in that when button is clicked and form slides down i should no longer see the button - so first timw in the class will be added. then next time removed.
